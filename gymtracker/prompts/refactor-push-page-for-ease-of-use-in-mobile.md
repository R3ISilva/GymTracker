# Task Context
Push page will be discontinued
We must migrate contents and logic but not structure

# Task
- Lets change workout.tsx to instead of going to push page, we will show in current page the following:
# EPAH SECALHAR O MELHOR E RE-ESCREVER A PAGINA APARTIR DE UM JSON COM A DATA TODA {PUSH: [{Gif:"", Name:"", Id:""},{...}], Pull:[...]...
Show a list of panes

<Panes>
    <NExercise>
        </Gif>
        </Reps>
        </Weight>
        </Notes>
        <ButtonNext>
        - Takes you to next exercise
        - After the last pane the button must take you to Stats page
        </ButtonNext>
    </NExercise>
</Panes>

Use logic of Push page as reference logic and use the same data
